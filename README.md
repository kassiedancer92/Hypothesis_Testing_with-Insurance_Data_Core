# Hypothesis Testing w/ Insurance Data


### Answer the following Questions:
 Q1. Do smokers have higher insurance charges than non-smokers?
 Q2. Are men more likely to smoke than women?
 Q3. Do different regions have different charges, on average?


### Question 1: 
State your Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis
- H0: There is no difference between insurance charges of smokers and no smokers
- H1: There is a difference between insurance charges of smokers and no smokers

Select the correct test according to the data type and number of samples
 - T test, comparing two samples
   
Interpret your p-value and reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis
- Reject null, the p value is smaller than .05

### Question 2: 
State your Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis
- H0: There is no difference between in the likely hood of men smoking vs women smoking
- H1: There is a difference between in the likely hood of men smoking vs women smoking
  
Select the correct test according to the data type and number of samples
- Chi-Sqaure
  
Interpret your p-value and reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis
- Reject null, the p value is smaller than .05

### Question 3: 
State your Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis
- H0: There is no difference between different regions have different charges, on average
- H1: There is a difference between different regions have different charges, on average
  
Select the correct test according to the data type and number of samples
- ANOVA
  
Test the assumptions of your selected test.
- Fails equal variance
  
Execute the selected test, or the alternative test (if you do not meet the assumptions)
- Use Krukal
  
Interpret your p-value and reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis
- Fail to reject the null as p is more than .05. This means there is a difference betwen groups with charges. Post Hoc shows there is a sig diff only between southeast and southwest
